# âš½ Football Player Overall Prediction

This project predicts the **overall rating** of football players based on their key attributes using **regression models**.  
Multiple algorithms were compared, and the best-performing model (**LightGBM Regressor**) was deployed through a **FastAPI** backend and a simple web UI with a FIFA-style card.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Input features: `Pace`, `Shooting`, `Passing`, `Dribbling`, `Defending`, `Physic` (range: 0â€“99).
- Multiple regression models trained and compared.
- **LightGBM Regressor** achieved the best performance (RÂ² = 0.968).
- REST API built with **FastAPI**:
  - `/predict` â†’ returns model predictions
  - `/` â†’ serves the HTML UI
- Interactive **web UI**:
  - Sliders + numeric inputs for attributes
- Model + scaler stored via `pickle` for reproducibility.
